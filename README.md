Nucleosomal DNA Dynamics

The nucleosomes have been of great interest due to their importance in chromatin function. They are the main template for diverse vital processes, such as transcription, replication, recombination, DNA repair, and cell division. Although there are several molecular dynamics studies on how histone dynamics regulate the nucleosome function, the relevance of nucleosomal DNA dynamics is yet to be determined.

Here we explore the role of force fields in reproducing the experimentally observed nucleosomal DNA (nucDNA) geometries and we compare two state-of-the-art protein-DNA force fields, i.e., AMBER parmbsc1 and CHARMM36. We used 601 nucleosome for this study due to its stable structure. Then, with DNA geometry analysis (such as RMSD, RMSF, Groove Widths and Base Pair Parameters) we tried to understand the effect of the force fields on the nucleosome geometries.

We calculated groove widths and base pair parameters by using 3DNA tool and after that we analyze the outputs. We used the maximum, minimum and average values of each parameter (You can find our scripts for this analysis under “test_script” file.).

Following this, we visualized our results and interpret them.
